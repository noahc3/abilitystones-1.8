## A warning

A lot of the code in this mod does not follow good coding practice. I am using this mod to learn the Minecraft Forge API. While the code technically works, use it at your own risk.

## Building

Open command window at root directory of the project and execute "gradlew build".

## Contributing

If you want to help improve the project, such as the awful coding practice, feel free. If you have any suggestions or bug reports, open a new issue (MAKE SURE SUGGESTIONS ARE CLEARLY MARKED!).

## License

Do whatever you want with the code, as long as you understand the disclaimer above.
